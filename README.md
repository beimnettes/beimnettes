# 👋 Hey there! I'm Beimnet Tesfaye

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a hands-on Application Development student who loves building real-world, useful things. Whether I'm crafting a clean React frontend, writing solid Java logic, or debugging for way too long (relatable?), this is where I share my learning journey one commit at a time.

## 💻 Currently Working On

- Diving deeper into full-stack projects using React, Java, and PostgreSQL
- Learning cloud-native tools and better deployment workflows
- Making apps that are not just functional, but clean, user-friendly

## 🚀 A Bit About Me

I'm someone who enjoys both the logic *and* the creative side of tech. I’ve built everything from student record systems and base converters to full-stack CRUD apps. 

I work as an AI Trainer and also have experience in security at Meta Campus so yes, I know how to be calm under pressure, spot details quickly, and solve problems from different angles.

Outside of coding, I express myself through digital art using Photoshop and Illustrator, and when I’m not doing that, I’m probably practicing piano, planning projects, or chasing down a new idea.

## 🧰 Tech I Use

- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL
- **Frameworks**: React, Node.js, Express
- **Tools**: Git & GitHub, VS Code, PostgreSQL, Firebase, ProjectLibre, Adobe Suite
- **Learning**: TanStack Query, TypeScript, cloud deployment, and DB design patterns
